# RACIPEwb_stemness
The code for RACIPEwb framework to generate simulated gene expressions a nine component stemness gene regulatory network and analyze the network.

If you use this code please cite: Huang, B. et al. Decoding the mechanisms underlying cell-fate decision-making during stem cell differentiation by random circuit perturbation. J Roy Soc Interface 17, 20200500 (2020).


This code been extended from the original RACIPE framework to include the binding and unbinding of OCT4, SOX2, and the OCT4-SOX2 complex. This code is specifically for the nine-component stemness network.

The original RACIPE code (generalized for any network) can be found https://github.com/simonhb1990/RACIPE-1.0

## The code files
 + stem_originalRACIPE.c generates gene expression data for the nine-component stemness network using the original RACIPE framework
 + stem_racipe_withBinding.c generates gene expression data for the nine-component stemness network using the RACIPEwb framework
 + stem_threhold_for_racipeWB.c generates the thresholds for RACIPEwb

## Compiling RACIPEwb
mpic++ -std=c++11 stem_originalRACIPE.c -o racipeOG

mpic++ -std=c++11 stem_racipe_withBinding.c -o racipeWB

g++ stem_threhold_for_racipeWB.c -o thresholds

## Run RACIPEwb
mpirun -n 10 ./racipeOG og

mpirun -n 10 ./racipeWB wb

./thresholds 

## Folders
+ Results in the paper for the original framework use code and data in "originalFramework" written by co-authors
+ The "og" folder is the data generated by the original RACIPE framework and is used for analysis to compare with the RACIPEwb framework
+ The "sf*" folders have data generated by the RACIPEwb framework with different ranges of binding and unbinding parameters as outline in the SI
    * The "sf3" folder is the RACIPEwb generated data used in the main text and analysis
+ The "analyses" folder has the code used to analyze and compare the RACIPE and RACIPEwb frameworks
