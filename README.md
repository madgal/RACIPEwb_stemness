If you use this code please cite: Huang, B. et al. Decoding the mechanisms underlying cell-fate decision-making during stem cell differentiation by random circuit perturbation. J Roy Soc Interface 17, 20200500 (2020).


This code been extended from the original RACIPE framework to include the binding and unbinding of OCT4, SOX2, and the OCT4-SOX2 complex. This code is specifically for the nine-component stemness network.
